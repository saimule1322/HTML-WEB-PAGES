                    <td>Born in Tadepalli in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, India, in a well to do farming family, he grew up watching his father make herbal pills that he distributed free. Little did he realize the prophetic significance of what he saw.The seeds of his lifelong passion for pharmaceuticals were sown when he was pursuing a BSc Tech degree at the University Department of Chemical Technology, Mumbai. He went on to secure a Doctorate in Chemical Engineering, subsequently, from the National Chemical Laboratory, Pune. He then worked for six years at the state owned Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, where his entrepreneurial ambitions were fired. In 1973, he left IDPL and over the next ten years was part of the founding team of two bulk drug manufacturing ventures.
